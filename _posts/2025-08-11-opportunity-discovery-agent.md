While exploring AI automation tools like **n8n**, I wanted to see how AI could uncover business opportunities even without direct access to customer data.  
Thatâ€™s why I built the **Opportunity Discovery Agent** â€” a lightweight prototype that analyzes a companyâ€™s website, identifies potential pain points, and recommends automation solutions to address them.

**How it works:**  
1. **Input:** You provide a company website link  
2. **Automation:** n8n orchestrates the data extraction  
3. **AI Analysis:** The content is scanned for operational gaps  
4. **Output:** Actionable recommendations, such as automating repetitive tasks, deploying chat assistants, or improving data workflows

As an **AI Automation Engineer**, having a tool like this is important to me because it streamlines the process of identifying operational inefficiencies and hidden opportunities. Instead of relying on lengthy audits or scattered feedback, it provides a fast, structured, and repeatable way to pinpoint where automation could deliver the highest impact.  

What makes this agent even more valuable is its **scalability and adaptability**. The analysis criteria can be fine-tuned to focus on specific business outcomes â€” whether thatâ€™s uncovering new leads, optimizing internal workflows, or improving customer engagement. This means itâ€™s not just a one-off tool, but a foundation that can evolve alongside an organizationâ€™s priorities.

### The n8n Workflow

Below is the automation flow that powers the agent, built entirely in **n8n**. This visual workflow makes it easy to adapt the process for different industries, data sources, or analytical goals.
